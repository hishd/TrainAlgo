The RED paths means all the shortest paths generated
by the dijkstra algorithm when inserting the information 1, 3, 6, 10
so after using the combinations
1-3
1-6
1-10
3-6
3-10
6-10

and applying dijkstra we generate the subgraph containing edges for only the above vertices

then after sending the subgraph for the prims algorithm it generates the graph in BLUE
the blue paths means the minimum connectors needed for the above input vertices (1, 3, 6, 10)
